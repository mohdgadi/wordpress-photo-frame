"PhotoFrame is a beautiful and free Photography WordPress theme for fine art, "
"bridal, family, portrait and wedding photographers that need a stylish "
"website focused on delivering a great experience. A great deal of effort and "
"attention went into making PhotoFrame a theme that will surprise you with "
"its style and features. A full screen hero slideshow will present your "
"photos with minimal distractions. Post thumbnails are portrait-sized (1:1,5)."
" Some notable features: 1. The logo automatically switches from dark to "
"light depending on the brightness of the hero image. 2. The header comes in "
"two layouts: default (logo on the left, menu on the right) and centered "
"(menu under logo). 3. A sticky menu that elegantly sits at the top of the "
"page when visitors scroll. 4. Three widgetized areas in the footer."
