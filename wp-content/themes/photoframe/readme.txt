== Description ==

PhotoFrame is a beautiful and free Photography WordPress theme for fine art, bridal, family, portrait, studio and wedding photographers that need a stylish website focused on delivering a great experience. A great deal of effort and attention went into making PhotoFrame a theme that will surprise you with its style and features. A full screen hero slideshow will present your photos with minimal distractions. Post thumbnails are portrait-sized (1:1,5). Some noteable features: 
1. The logo automatically switches from dark to light depending on the brightness of the hero image. 
2. The header comes in two layouts: default (logo on the left, menu on the right) and centered (menu under logo). 
3. A sticky menu that elegantly sits at the top of the page when visitors scroll. 
4. Three widgetized areas in the footer. 


== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

When you first activate Photoframe, your homepage will display posts in a traditional blog format. If you would like to add the additional featured sections from the demo, you can do that by going to Appearance > Customize > Theme Settings.

The footer area contains 3 widgetized columns of equal width.

== Quick Specs (all measurements in pixels) ==

	1. The main column width is 660.
	2. In full-width layout the content width is 1100.
	3. Featured Images for posts should be at least 320 wide (for archive pages).
	4. Featured Images for posts and pages should be at least 1600 if hero images are enabled in Appearance > Customize > Theme Settings.
	5. The footer widget columns are of equal width: 320.
